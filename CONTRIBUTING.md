## Overview
This project provides an obfuscated version of the source code to protect proprietary logic while maintaining open collaboration for certain aspects such as bug reports, documentation, and feature requests. We welcome all contributions that comply with these guidelines.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior, please open an issue on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) page with the following details:
- A clear description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant logs or screenshots.
  
Please check existing issues before submitting a new one to avoid duplicates.

## Feature Requests
We are happy to hear suggestions for new features! To submit a feature request, please open an issue labeled "Feature Request" and provide the following:
- A detailed description of the feature.
- The problem it aims to solve or improve.
- Potential use cases or scenarios where this feature would be beneficial.

## Submitting Pull Requests
We are primarily accepting contributions related to:
- External integrations (e.g., third party editor integeration add-on)
- CSS Styles

Since the main codebase is obfuscated and not open-sourced, pull requests should not modify core functionality. If you are unsure whether a contribution is appropriate, feel free to discuss it by opening an issue first.

### Guidelines for Pull Requests:
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure your code adheres to the style guides.
3. Write clear commit messages.
4. Test your changes thoroughly before submitting.

For major changes, please open an issue to discuss the change first.

## Code Obfuscation Policy
Please note that the core code is distributed in an obfuscated format to protect intellectual property. We cannot accept contributions that require modifications to the core source code. If you believe a change to the core logic is necessary, please open an issue to discuss possible workarounds.

## Setting Up Your Environment
Although the core code is obfuscated, you can set up a development environment for contributing to peripheral components such as tests, documentation, or front-end enhancements by following these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
