This is a Typescript library for rendering customized markdown syntax and providing tex2svg for server-side rendering.

This library is a repack of MathJax and marked.js.

This project is utilized in our mathematical visualization project for educatinal use and provides limited technical support on github.

## Features

- Support CommonMark syntax.
- Support auto-numbering footnotes and generating ref links.

```

## Usage

```
import { tex2svg } from '@mathcrowd/mathcrowd-marked-lib'

const svg = tex2svg('$x^2$')
const html = renderMarkdown('###Heading')
```
